<p>My name is Yash Patel, and I am from San Francisco, California. I graduated from Cathedral School For Boys, a Kindergarten-8th Grade private school near Grace Cathedral. Currently I attend a boarding school in Delaware named St. Andrew's. In September of 2019, I will be a Junior. At school I participate in many clubs and activities. I am a part of three sports teams: The Soccer Team, The Basketball Team, and The Baseball Team. I am also a member of the schools Jazz Ensemble, a member of the South Asian Affinity Group, and many more! Outside of school, I love to watch sports. Besides that, I am starting to persue a passion of Photography. Whenever I can, I go out out and explore the different aspects of Photography. I love to mess around with different apperture and shutter speeds to create cool images. I hope this short bio about myself will help you to better understand me! Happy Exploring Throughout My Page!</p>
<p>PS: I wouldn't have been able to create this website without the help of Holberton. <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">Holberton</a> is a school located in San Francisco that helps students learn to code. The summer of 2019, I attended a short two week camp summer coding camp. Thanks again Holberton for the amazing experience!</p>
