      <p> At St. Andrew's the community is an important aspect for each student. "Boarding school life—living in residence with your teachers and your friends—is a unique, thrilling, and challenging experience. St. Andrew's is extra-unique, in that it is a 100% residential boarding school, and 95% of our faculty also live on campus or on dorm. Our students and alumni often note their most significant learning experiences occurred in informal conversations with friends and teachers on dorm, in the halls, or on the fields. We believe that the best education is that which involves not only learning in the classroom and from books, but also deep and meaningful relationships formed with peers and mentors within the school community. With this principle in mind, living and working at St. Andrew's becomes deeply rewarding, for both students and their teachers." In order to engage, and make each student feel welcome, the students(club leaders, club members, sports captains, etc...)and faculty organize countless activities. In order to embrace our community, we also encourage any and everyone to speak up and feel confident. Therefore we even have new freshman organizing events. Some examples seen below:</p>
